Create a simple Java gRPC client application that sends a request to the simple server (share the same proto file), gets a response, and prints it.
Create a simple gRPC client application in any other language you like (or ask a trainer/lector for a Python example) that sends a request to the simple server, gets a response, and prints it. Use the same proto file.
Start a server and try to communicate with it using the clients you just wrote.
